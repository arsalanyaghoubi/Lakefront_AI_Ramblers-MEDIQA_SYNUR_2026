# Dataset Card: MEDIQA-SYNUR

## 1. Dataset Summary

- **Name**: MEDIQA-SYNUR
- **Full name / acronym**: MEDIQA Competition on **SYnthetic NURsing Observation Extraction**
- **Purpose / use case**:
  SYNUR is intended to support research in structuring nurse dictation transcripts by extracting clinical observations that can feed into flowsheet-style EHR entries. It is designed to reduce documentation burden by enabling automated conversion from spoken nurse assessments to structured observations. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05517))
- **Version**: MEDIQA-SYNUR @ ClinicalNLP / LREC 2026
- **License / usage terms**: cdla-permissive-2.0

## 2. Train and Development Sets

- Trainset
  - Filename: `train.jsonl`
  - Size: 122 samples.
- Development
  - Filename: `dev.jsonl`
  - Size: 101 samples.

## 3. Data Fields / Format

- `transcript`: string, the nurse dictation (raw spoken text)
- `observations`: JSON dumped of list of dictionaries with following format
   - `id` (str): key of observation in schema.
   - `value_type` (str): type of observation in {*SINGLE_SELECT*, *MULTI_SELECT*, *STRING*, *NUMERIC*}.
   - `name` (str): observation concept name.
   - `value` (any): value of observation.

## 4. Observation Schema

The full ontology (i.e., 193 observation concepts) is provided in the zip folder as `synur_schema.json`. It is a list of dictionaries with the following key-value pairs:

- `id` (str): key of observation concept.
- `name` (str): observation concept name.
- `value_type` (str): type of observation in {*SINGLE_SELECT*, *MULTI_SELECT*, *STRING*, *NUMERIC*}.
- `value_enum` (List[str], *optional*): set of possible string values for *SINGLE_SELECT* and *MULTI_SELECT* value types.
